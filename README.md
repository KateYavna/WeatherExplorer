# WeatherExplorer
Create a ASP.NET Core application that integrates with a third-party API to retrieve weather data. The application should allow users to search for weather data by zip code or city name. 
Use EF to persist weather data to a local database. Use Task Scheduler to periodically refresh weather data from the third-party API.
